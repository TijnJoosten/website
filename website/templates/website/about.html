			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				My name is Tijn Joosten. I am a 3rd year Artificial Intelligence student at the Radboud University in Nijmegen.
				Outside of my study I spend a lot of time broadening my skills with some projects on the side. One of these projects is the site you are currently reading!
				More information of these projects can be found all over this site (once added)!
			</p>
			<h2>Vartion</h2>
			<p>
				Apart from these projects, I also try to gain practical experience by working in my field. For example, I worked as a part-time AI engineer for Vartion for one year.
				Here I learned a lot about AI in general, but also a lot about working in a team and actually making sure my code is able to be used.
				I learned how to research ways to use AI to solve problems and how to convert these ideas into prototypes using the scrum methodology.
