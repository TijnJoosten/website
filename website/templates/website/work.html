					<h2>Vartion</h2>
					<p>
						Apart from these projects, I also try to gain practical experience by working in my field. For example, I worked as a part-time AI engineer for Vartion for one year.
						Here I learned a lot about AI in general, but also a lot about working in a team and actually making sure my code is able to be used.
						I learned how to research ways to use AI to solve problems and how to convert these ideas into prototypes using the scrum methodology.
